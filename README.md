* **Here we have used the re module that provide support for regular expressions in Python.**
* **Along with this the re.search() method returns False (if the first parameter is not found in the second parameter) This method is best suited for testing a regular expression more than extracting data. **
* **We have used the re.search() to check the validation of alphabets, digits or special characters.**
* **To check for white spaces we use the “\s” which comes in the module of the regular expression.**
